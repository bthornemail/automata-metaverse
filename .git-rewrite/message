Next steps

  To trigger the GitHub workflow:

  git push origin evolution

  The workflow will automatically:
  1. Run automaton evolution (5 minutes default)
  2. Capture snapshots using Meta-Log-Db
  3. Analyze evolution patterns
  4. Generate optimized variants
  5. Validate variants
  6. Commit updated variants back to the evolution branch

  Monitor the workflow:

  After pushing, you can monitor the workflow at:
  • GitHub Actions: https://github.com/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/evolution.yml
  • Check workflow logs for progress
  • Review generated artifacts

  The evolution logging system is committed and ready to use.
